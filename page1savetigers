	        <li> Why is it important to save Tigers?</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Saving tigers is equivalent to conserving the Ecosystem
Tiger is symbol of wilderness and well-being of the ecosystem. By conserving and saving tigers the entire wilderness ecosystem is conserved. In nature, barring human beings and their domesticates, rest of the ecosystem is wild. Hence conserving wilderness is important and crucial to maintain the life support system. So saving tiger amounts to saving the ecosystem which is crucial for man's own survival.</li>

<li>Tigers play a pivotal role in the health of the ecosystem. Tigers constitute the top carnivores in the ecosystem and is at the apex of the food chain. The removal of a top carnivore from an ecosystem can have an impact on the relative abundance of herbivore species within a guild. Along with other major carnivores as leopard it acts as a control mechanism for herbivores or consumers.</li>

<li>The interdependency of living forms in a food chain is obvious as the wild tiger is dependant upon herbivores for its survival where he maintains there population which in turn prevents the grasslands from being overgrazed. The herbivores depend upon the producers as grasses, herbs, shrubs, algae, fungi and large trees for survival and they in turn maintian a balance in vegetation by controling the extent of vegetation or flora. Birds survive on herbs, shrubs and trees on fruits and nector and in turn act as seed dispersal agent for them to spread the population of the floral elements in an ecosystem. Thus all life forms including tiger are interlinked with each other in an ecosystem and their survival depends upon how intact the ecosystem is.</li>

<li>Top carnivores, tigers, have an important role to play in the structuring of communities and ultimately of ecosystems. Thus, the preservation of tigers becomes an important consideration.</li>
